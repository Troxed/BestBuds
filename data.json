A deeper whiff may pick up on some sweet, fruity bass notes as well. Grinding up or cracking open these flowers, on the other hand, reveals their Kush lineage with a hashy, peppery kick. When Ghost Cookies is combusted in a pipe or a joint, it burns with a heavy but pleasantly smooth and easily ingested smoke. This smoke tastes earthy with some fruity accents on the exhale.\r\n\r\nAs with many other indica-dominant strains, Ghost CookiesÆ high can be a creeper, taking 10 or 15 minutes to manifest after users have finished smoking.

External stimuli may become subject to weird distortions like a flattening of visual depth perspective; consumers also report psychedelic phenomena like a sense of time moving more slowly. Those who are so inclined can maximize these hazy properties by listening to some moody music or watching a visually engaging movie. Alternatively, Ghost Cookies can provide a great backdrop for buzzy social situations, facilitating easy conversation and good vibes.
